Steps to be done to execute Reboot script.
1. source the profile.
   source ~/.profile (Incase if you are not able to source. please copy the profile file from 10.104.45.88 make sure you have    the paths mentioned in the file)
2. Execute "run.py" which is located under  "/home/tester/vtest-tools/confd_server"
   python run.py
3. Execute the below commands in Jumphost
   unset http_proxy
   unset https_proxy
4. Install texttable package in your Jumphost.
   python2.7 -m pip install texttable --user
5. Go to "/home/tester/vtest-tools/" path in your jumhost and copy the entire "lib" folder from 10.104.45.88
   Go to "/home/tester/" path in your jumhost and copy the entire "ixia" folder from 10.104.45.88
   cd /home/tester/vtest-tools/
   scp -r tester@10.104.45.88:/home/tester/vtest-tools/lib/ .
   scp -r tester@10.104.45.88:/home/tester/ixia/ .
6. Go to "/home/tester/vtest-tools/flat_input/topology_yamls/" and copy the "bglsystemtestbed.yaml" file from 10.104.45.88.
   Note: you might have a yaml file in your jumphost for CLI regression with the same name "bglsystemtestbed.yaml"
   If you already have a yaml file with that same name""bglsystemtestbed.yaml"" then rename it. As of now copy and use     "bglsystemtestbed.yaml" for REST API. please update the yaml with your setup details. 
   cd /home/tester/vtest-tools/flat_input/topology_yamls/
   scp tester@10.104.45.88:/home/tester/vtest-tools/flat_input/topology_yamls/bglsystemtestbed.yaml .
7. Go to "/home/tester/vtest-tools/suites" path and copy "BglSystemtestbedDeviceConfigs" folder from 10.104.45.88
   cd /home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/
   scp -r tester@10.104.45.88:/home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/BglSystemtestbedDeviceConfigs/ .
8. Copy appqoe_system.py and cli_checks.py and script_ixload.py files from 10.104.45.88.
   cd /home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/
   scp tester@10.104.45.88:/home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/appqoe_system.py.
   scp tester@10.104.45.88:/home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/cli_checks.py.
9.  Provide the list of boxes in pm_vedges list for reboot.
    Number of devices and reboots can be changed in the below code according to your setup and requirement.
    @run.test(['RebootDevices'])
    def RebootDevices(self):
       pm_vedges = ['pm9006'] # change the list according to the setup:ex: ['pm9006', 'pm9008']
       pm_vedges = ['pm9006']
       failcount = 0
       PushfailedDevices = []
       table_result = []
       for i in range(1): # Number of reboot need to mentioned inside range. ex:range(50)
   
       
10. Once you are done with all these changes you are ready to go.
    cd /home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/
    To execute soak script on cedges you need to execute the below command under "/home/tester/vtest-tools/suites/" path. 
    python appqoe_system.py bglsystemtestbed -t test_soak_test -ntg -nt -ne -no_slack
